## Outcomes

Describe a typical SCRUM and Kanban process and show where threat model related building blocks fit.

## Synopsis and Takeaways 

Presentation of SCRUM and Kanban processes with discussion on how Threat Modeling would fit in. The session used the Four Questions that form the basis of all Threat Models in relation to team members and generic activities in the software development lifecycle.

### Identified Questions

- A threat model is a good training model but how do we capture it in terms of SCRUM or Agile?
- Can a generic diagram capture this?
- Is this a management, developer, or security issue?
- Do you apply security to the design, or does the developer design to security issues?
