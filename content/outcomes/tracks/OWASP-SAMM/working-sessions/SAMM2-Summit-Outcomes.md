## Outcomes/Deliverables 

The outcomes of our SAMM working sessions are:
 * Processed feedback on Alpha version of SAMMv2 Core Model outline (tracked with GitHub Issues)
 * Got feedback/integrated from the DevSecOps maturity model folks
 * Had input from Jeff Williams on an DevOps version of SAMM
 * Got review/input from DevSecOps SME (Timo) for the implementation business function
 * Defined a draft source markdown structure of the model
 * Create a beta (improved) SAMMv2 Core Model outline (without activity details)
 * First publication to a Hugo based website of the model
 * Plan for six two-week writing sprints detailing the Core Model activities (five activity streams per sprint)
 * Planned a SAMM Summit in the US mid-October
 * More contributors joined the project team (John Dileo, Chris Cooper)
 * Extracted a markdown version of SAMMv1.5 (from the PDF) - Becky
 * Got a publication workflow from markdown to PDF / ePub - Sherif
